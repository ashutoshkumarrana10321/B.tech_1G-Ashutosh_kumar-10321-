FREEDOM FIGHTERS </h1>

     <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style: italic">
        A freedom fighter is a person engaged in a struggle 
        to achieve political freedom, particularly against 
        an established government. The term is typically
        reserved for those who are actively involved in
        armed or otherwise violent rebellion.
        A freedom fighter is different from a mercenary as
        they gain no direct material benefit from being
        involved in a conflict, though they may have no
       personal reason for being involved.
